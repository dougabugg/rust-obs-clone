# rust-obs-clone
A clone of Open Broadcaster Software Studio written in Rust

# Why make a clone?
It's a personal decision; I have nothing against the existing OBS code base and it's contributors, but I have recently learned that jumping into an existing code base can (sometimes) be more difficult than just building your own from scratch, with more modern tooling. That's the motivation behind this project, basically.
